                                             Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage?   
                                        </h2>
                                        <p>
                                           localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network).     
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                             Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.   
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related data within applications.

                                        <p>The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.</p>

                                                A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

                                                 A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

                                        <p>
                                                Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. If you declare a local variable or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you effectively hide the global variable.

                                                Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises

It's up to the browser to decide how many queues to have and what form of prioritisation to give them. There's no Javascript interface to individual event queues or to send events to a particular queue.

                                                        The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed ,

                                                when do we get undefined in javascript?
                                        </h2>

                                        <p>
                                                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned .
                                        </p>

                                        <p>JavaScript also has the null value. In addition, it has the undefined value. And both null and undefined values represent empty values in JavaScript.</p>
                                        <p>What is undefined
                                                The undefined is a primitive type in JavaScript. So the undefined is a type. And the undefined type has exactly one value that is undefined.</p>
                                        <p>JavaScript uses the undefined value in the following situations.</p>
                                        <p>1) Accessing an uninitialized variable
                                                When you declare a variable and don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value of undefined. For example:

                                                let counter;
                                                console.log(counter); // undefined
                                                Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
                                                It’s a good practice to always initialize a variable whenever possible. In this example, you can initialize the counter variable to zero, like this:

                                                let counter = 0;
                                                console.log(counter); // 0
                                        </p>
                                        <p>2) Accessing a non-existing property of an object
                                                If you access a non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined. </p>
                                        <p>3) Function parameters
                                                When you call a function with a number of parameters, you often pass the same number of arguments. </p>
                                        <p>4) Functions return a value
                                                A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns undefined. </p>
                                        <p>5) Accessing out-of-bounds array elements
                                        When you access an array element that is out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value. </p>

                                                
                                </div>
